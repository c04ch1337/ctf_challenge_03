# How to Play CTF Challenges

## What is a CTF?
Capture The Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to find hidden "flags." These flags are often strings of text hidden in vulnerable systems.

## Tools and Methodologies
1. **Web Exploitation**: Use tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and browser developer tools.
2. **Network Analysis**: Use Wireshark or Nmap to analyze network traffic.
3. **Password Cracking**: Use tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat.
4. **Reverse Engineering**: Use Ghidra or IDA Pro for binary analysis.
5. **Scripting**: Write custom scripts in Python, Bash, or other languages to automate tasks.

## Getting Started
1. Access the CTF server at `http://localhost:83`.
2. Explore the CMS and look for vulnerabilities.
3. Use the tools and methodologies mentioned above to find the flags.
4. Submit the flags to the competition admin to score points.
